Tenny wouldn't come into fruition without these third party products that I used during development. So let's give them a big hand! :clap: 

* Alessandro Roncone ([@alecive](https://github.com/alecive)) for the beautiful timer icon used by Tenny.
* [PyInstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller) for packaging and freezing Tenny into an executable file.
